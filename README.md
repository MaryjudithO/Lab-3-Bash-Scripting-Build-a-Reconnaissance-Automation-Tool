# Lab 3: Bash Scripting - Build a Reconnaissance Tool

## Student Information

- Name: Maryjudith Chidinma Ogunaka
- Programme: ICDFA Trainee | Cohort 11
- Lab: Lab 3 - Bash Scripting
- Authorised Target: 10.15.203.91

## Project Description

For this lab, I built a Bash script that automates three reconnaissance tools: WhatWeb, Nmap, and DIRB into a single menu-driven tool. The script prompts the user for an authorised target, validates the input, displays a menu, and runs the selected reconnaissance tool against the target.

## Features

- Accepts user-supplied target input
- No hardcoded target
- Input validation
- Menu-driven interface
- Uses Bash `if` statements
- Uses Bash `case` statements
- Executes WhatWeb
- Executes Nmap
- Executes DIRB
- Checks required tools before execution

## Tools Used

- Bash
- Nmap
- WhatWeb
- DIRB

## Usage

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x recon_tool.sh
```

Run the script:

```bash
./recon_tool.sh
```
